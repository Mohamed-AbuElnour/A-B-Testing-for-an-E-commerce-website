# A-B-Testing-for-an-E-commerce-website


## Introduction

For this project, I'm going to make am A/B test for an e-commerce website to help the them understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## A/B Testing Results:


- **Statistical Significance:** 

> As **P-value > alpha (0.05)**, then we **can't reject the null hypothesis** that states (conversions from the new web page interface is less than or equal the old one). In other words,  there is no significant difference between the new and old pages.

> Merely depending on this result, the e-commerce website shouldn't launch the new page.

- **Practical Significance:** 

> The **experiment** for the new page lasted for **21 days**. It seems a short period for deciding whether or not to launch the new page. Generally speaking, shopping can be subject to seasonal factors. For example, there is a surge in shopping and retailing during Christmas whereas there's a standstill in other times. The experiment was run after the Christmas (from 2 Jan 2017 to 24 Jan 2017) at a time when the shopping boom has subsided. Therefore, there's a risk that this sample doesn't represent the general behavior of customers. 

> ***Due to the lack of sufficient data that represents the truth, I would recommend to wait for several months (let's say 4 months) so that the data can represent different business cycles (from boom to trough) with a wider spectrum of customers, thereby our analysis can give more reliable insights about the appropriate page to adopt .***
